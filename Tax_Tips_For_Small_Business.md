# Tax Tips for Small Business Owners

This guide provides valuable tax tips to help small business owners and self-employed individuals maximize deductions and comply with IRS requirements when filing Schedule C.

## Record-Keeping Best Practices

### 1. Separate Business and Personal Finances
- Open a dedicated business bank account and credit card
- Never commingle personal and business funds
- Pay yourself a "draw" from the business account for personal use

### 2. Keep Detailed Records
- Save all receipts (digital or physical)
- Record date, amount, vendor, and business purpose
- Use accounting software or this Excel template to track expenses
- Regularly reconcile bank and credit card statements

### 3. Document Everything
- For business meals: note who you met with and business purpose
- For travel: keep itineraries and document business activities
- For vehicle expenses: maintain a mileage log with dates, destinations, and purpose
- For home office: measure and document the space used exclusively for business

## Maximizing Legitimate Deductions

### 1. Don't Miss These Commonly Overlooked Deductions
- Business-related education and professional development
- Professional subscriptions and memberships
- Business insurance premiums
- Banking and credit card processing fees
- Business-related software subscriptions
- Portion of cell phone and internet used for business
- Home office expenses (if you qualify)
- Self-employed health insurance (reported on Schedule 1, not Schedule C)
- Retirement plan contributions (SEP IRA, Solo 401(k), etc.)

### 2. Vehicle Expenses
- Track all business mileage with a log or app
- Choose between:
  - Standard mileage rate (simplest method)
  - Actual expenses (gas, maintenance, insurance, depreciation)
- You can switch methods, but there are restrictions if you've claimed depreciation

### 3. Home Office Deduction
- Must be used **regularly and exclusively** for business
- Two calculation methods:
  - Simplified method: $5 per square foot (max 300 sq ft)
  - Regular method: Calculate percentage of home used and apply to expenses
- Regular method typically yields larger deduction but requires more record-keeping

## Tax Planning Strategies

### 1. Timing of Income and Expenses
- Consider deferring income to next year if beneficial
- Accelerate deductible expenses at year-end if it helps your tax situation
- Purchase needed business equipment before year-end to utilize Section 179 deduction

### 2. Estimated Tax Payments
- Make quarterly estimated tax payments to avoid penalties
- Due dates: April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15
- Consider setting aside 25-30% of profits for taxes
- Include self-employment tax in your calculations (15.3% on net earnings)

### 3. Retirement Planning
- Contribute to a retirement plan to reduce taxable income
- Options include SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA, or Solo 401(k)
- Contributions may be deductible on your personal return

### 4. Hire Family Members
- Consider hiring your spouse or children if they perform legitimate work
- Children under 18 are exempt from FICA taxes in sole proprietorships
- Children can use their standard deduction (potentially tax-free income)
- Document hours worked and pay reasonable wages

## Audit Protection

### 1. Know the Red Flags
- Unusually large deductions relative to income
- Home office deduction with little other business activity
- 100% business use of a vehicle
- Large entertainment/meal deductions
- Round numbers throughout your return

### 2. Documentation is Your Best Defense
- Keep all receipts for at least 7 years
- Document business purpose for expenses
- Take photos of business assets and workspaces
- Maintain a separate calendar for business activities
- Keep contracts, invoices, and communications with clients

### 3. Consider Professional Help
- Tax laws change frequently
- A professional can help identify deductions you may miss
- The cost of tax preparation is itself a deductible business expense
- For complex situations, the peace of mind may be worth the expense
