# Home Office Deduction Worksheet

This worksheet will help you calculate your home office deduction for Schedule C. Remember that to qualify for this deduction, you must use a portion of your home **regularly and exclusively** for business.

## Qualification Checklist

Before proceeding, confirm you meet one of these requirements:
- [ ] The home office is your principal place of business
- [ ] You regularly meet clients or customers in your home office
- [ ] It's a separate structure used for business (e.g., detached garage converted to an office)

- [ ] You operate a daycare facility in your home

## Space Measurement

**Total square footage of home**: ____________ sq ft

**Square footage used for business**: ____________ sq ft

**Business percentage of home**: ____________ % (Business sq ft ÷ Total sq ft)

## Two Calculation Methods

### 1. Simplified Method
- Fixed rate of $5 per square foot of business space
- Maximum space: 300 square feet
- Maximum deduction: $1,500

**Calculation**: Business sq ft (max 300) × $5 = $____________

### 2. Regular Method
Calculate the business percentage of these expenses:

| Expense Type | Total Annual Amount | Business % | Business Amount |
|--------------|---------------------|------------|-----------------|
| Mortgage interest | $ | % | $ |
| Real estate taxes | $ | % | $ |
| Homeowners/renters insurance | $ | % | $ |
| Rent payments | $ | % | $ |
| Repairs and maintenance (whole-home) | $ | % | $ |
| Utilities (electric, gas, water, etc.) | $ | % | $ |
| Internet and phone (business %) | $ | % | $ |
| Depreciation (calculated separately) | $ | % | $ |
| Other home expenses | $ | % | $ |
| **Total indirect expenses** | | | $ |

**Direct expenses** (100% for home office only):
- Office maintenance/repairs: $____________
- Paint/supplies for office: $____________
- Other direct expenses: $____________
- **Total direct expenses**: $____________

**Total home office deduction** (Regular Method): $____________
(Sum of business portion of indirect expenses plus direct expenses)

## Depreciation Calculation (For Regular Method)

If you own your home and use the regular method, you'll need to calculate depreciation:

**Value of home when converted to business use**: $____________

**Land value** (not depreciable): $____________

**Basis for depreciation** (home value minus land value): $____________

**Business percentage**: ____________%

**Depreciable basis** (basis × business %): $____________

**Depreciation rate**: 2.461% (39-year recovery for non-residential or 27.5-year for residential)

**Annual depreciation**: $____________ (Depreciable basis × depreciation rate)

## Important Notes

1. **Double-dipping warning**: Expenses claimed as itemized deductions on Schedule A cannot also be claimed as business expenses.

2. **Record-keeping**: Take photos of your home office and keep receipts for all home-related expenses.

3. **Regular and exclusive use**: The area must be used regularly and exclusively for business with few exceptions.

4. **Method switching**: Special rules apply when switching between simplified and regular methods.

5. **Income limitation**: Home office deduction cannot exceed the gross income from your business.

6. **Form 8829**: If using the regular method, complete Form 8829 and attach it to your tax return.

7. **Future implications**: Using the regular method and claiming depreciation may have tax implications when selling your home.
