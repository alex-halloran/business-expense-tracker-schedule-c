# Business Mileage Log Template

Vehicle expenses are often one of the largest tax deductions for small business owners. The IRS requires contemporaneous documentation of business mileage, meaning you should record trips at or near the time they occur. Below is a template you can use to track your business mileage for tax purposes.

## Instructions

1. Make a copy of this log for each vehicle used for business
2. Record your odometer reading at the beginning of each year
3. Log each business trip with all required information
4. Calculate total business miles at the end of the year
5. Keep this log for at least 7 years with your tax records

## Important Notes

1. **Commuting is NOT deductible**: Travel between your home and regular workplace is considered commuting and is not deductible.

2. **Home office exception**: If you have a qualifying home office that is your principal place of business, trips from home to business locations may be deductible.

3. **Temporary work locations**: Travel to temporary work locations may be deductible.

4. **Record-keeping methods**: You can use a paper log, spreadsheet, or mobile app to track mileage, but the information must be contemporaneous and complete.

5. **Two methods for claiming vehicle expenses**:
   - **Standard mileage rate**: Multiply business miles by the IRS standard rate (check IRS.gov for current rate)
   - **Actual expenses**: Track all vehicle operating costs and multiply by business-use percentage

6. **Switching methods**: Special rules apply if you switch between standard mileage rate and actual expenses, especially if you've claimed depreciation.

## End-of-Year Checklist

- Calculate total business miles and business-use percentage
- If using actual expenses method, gather all vehicle expense receipts
- Transfer summary information to Schedule C
- Keep this log with your tax records for at least 7 years
- Start a new log for the next tax year

Remember: Good mileage documentation is essential in case of an IRS audit. The more detailed your records, the better protected you'll be.
